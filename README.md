**Repository of Systems Analysis Workshops**

This repository houses a collection of projects developed as part of the Systems Analysis course workshops. Each folder represents a specific workshop, with its respective documentation and source code.

## Repository Structure

* **Structure by Workshop:** Each workshop is organized in an individual folder with a descriptive name (e.g., `taller1_deteccion_motivos`).
* **Contents of Each Folder:**
    * `README.md`: Detailed description of the workshop, objectives, methodology, results and conclusions.
    * `source_code`: Contains the project's source code files (e.g., `Main.java`, `Sequences.java`).
    * `documentation`: Additional documentation, such as diagrams, reports or presentations.

## Workshops

* **Workshop 1: Motif Detection in Genetic Sequences**
    * **Description:** Implementation of an algorithm to identify recurring patterns (motifs) in artificial genetic sequences.
    * **Technologies:** Java, pattern search algorithms.
    * **Results:** Development of an efficient program for motif detection, with evaluation of its performance and precision.
